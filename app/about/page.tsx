            Welcome to "Shit That Never Happened" â€” a digital museum dedicated to preserving the internet's most
            creative works of fiction disguised as real-life events.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            In an era where social media clout is currency, we've created a space to celebrate, archive, and gently mock
            the most outlandish stories that people share online for likes and retweets.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What We Collect</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Overheard Conversations</strong> - Those suspiciously perfect dialogues that somehow always prove
              the poster's worldview
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>My Kid Said</strong> - Children who apparently have the vocabulary and philosophical insight of
              tenured professors
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fake DMs</strong> - Those private messages from celebrities that conveniently can't be screenshot
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Random Encounters</strong> - Chance meetings with famous people that always end with applause
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Workplace Drama</strong> - Office confrontations where the poster always delivers the perfect
              comeback
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Community Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            While we enjoy a good laugh, we're not here to bully individuals. Our focus is on the phenomenon of
            fabricated stories, not attacking specific people. We moderate submissions to ensure they meet our standards
            for both humor and ethics.
